Everything we (&amp;Olga) have ever published is henceforth dedicated to the public domain.

In layman's terms, what this means is this: you are free to do anything you want with anything we have ever published (i.e. made <i>publicly available</i>, rather than shared via some private channel). There are no rules. You do not have to credit us (though you may, if you'd like). You do not have to provide any sort of "copyright notices" (in fact, please do not -- we <b>do not posess</b> the copyright to "our" works as a result of this dedication). You do not have to paste a LICENSE file into some folder, or provide our name in some "contributor list". Nothing.

If you need a bunch of legalese, then: <ul>
    <li>Our software can be considered to be under <a href="unlicense.txt">the UNLICENSE</a>.</li>
    <li>Our software <b>and</b> our other works of art can be considered to be under <a href="cc0.txt">CC0 1.0 Universal</a>.</li>
</ul>

Please keep in mind, though, that these are worthless words written to protect us (and you) against worthless people. Nobody in their right mind should care about this mumbo-jumbo. Just do whatever you want with the stuff we made.

A short FAQ follows, though you are free to skip this section.

<hr>

Q: Can I...<br>
A: Yes.

Q: Do I have to...<br>
A: No.

Q: What about future works?<br>
A: The dedication holds for them.

Q: Why not include the waiver with every published work?<br>
A: We try. However, it is sometimes impractical to do so.<br>Some publishing formats do not have a proper way to indicate licensing.<br>In some, adding a license causes side effects (for example: if you include an open license on GitHub to a project that relies on Jekyll, then Pages will add an ugly blob onto your site telling visitors to "contribute to the project", which is not what we want).<br>In some cases, the work has been created so long ago that going back to edit it is no longer practical: for example, it is published somewhere we no longer control.<br>In some cases we may have even forgotten it <i>exists</i>.

Q: What about partial and derivative works (such as forks or patches)?<br>
A: In regards to patches, the original license holds for the product being patched. Only our work alone is public domain.<br>In regards to forks, the original license holds for them, but if you somehow manage to rip out our contributions alone and reuse those out of the context of the original project, you can consider those to be public domain as well.

Q: Why do this at all?<br>
A: Any form of license or contract is fundamentally a <i>threat</i>. It outlines artifically created "rights" and "responsibilities", and then says: if you don't follow through with the "responsibilities", your "rights" are forfeit. Depending on who you're dealing with, the implicit threat may be even worse: if you don't follow through with the responsibilities, <i>we're going to sue you</i>.<br>Unless you, as a publisher, <i>intend to follow through</i> with your threat, your license will not protect you, as it only stops <i>good people</i> from doing the stuff your license prohibits (those who wouldn't do anything you're not comfortable with in the first place).<br>And if you <i>do</i> intend to do so, you <i>do</i> plan to ruin someone's life over a piece of software, a game, a video or a drawing: you're an asshole.<br>We most certainly do not intend to follow through with any threats related to our works: we have neither the desire nor the means to do so, and we <i>want</i> our stuff to be shared, spread around, and used as a building block. Therefore, we will simply not <b>make</b> any threats at all. In their place, we shall offer one word: enjoy.
